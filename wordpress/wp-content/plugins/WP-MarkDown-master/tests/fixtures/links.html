<p>Markdown supports two style of links: <em>inline</em> and <em>reference</em>. In both styles, the link text is delimited by <code>[square brackets]</code>.</p>

<p>To create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses immediately after the link text's closing square bracket. Inside the parentheses,
put the URL where you want the link to point, along with an <em>optional</em> title for the link, surrounded in quotes.</p>

<p>This is <a href="http://example.com/" title="Title">example</a> has a title. But <a href="http://example.net/">This link</a> does not.</p>

<p>Reference-style links use a second set of square brackets, inside which you place a label of your choosing to identify the link. This is <a href="http://example.com/" title="Optional Title Here">an example</a> of a reference-style link.</p>

<p>You can optionally use a space to separate the sets of brackets, suc as in <a href="http://example.com/" title="Optional Title Here">this example</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately in WP we have to worry about [shortcodes] which look a lot like links but really really aren't.</p>
