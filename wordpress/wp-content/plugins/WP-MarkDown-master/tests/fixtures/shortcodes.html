<p>WP shortcodes are problematic as they are very similar to MarkDown links. For instance:</p>

<p>This is a [shortcode] but this could be a shortcode and a link <a href="http://example.com/" title="Optional Title Here">another_shortcode</a>.</p>

<p>Don't worry if the identifier part isn't defined, it will be kept as a shortcode: [shortcode][third_shortcode].</p>
